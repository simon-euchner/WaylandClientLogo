Example of (probably) the most simple possible Wayland client. Running the
program should open a window with the Wayland logo. To build and run this
program, just run the Makefile. You may have to set the correct display in
*./src/logo.c* manually.

NOTE: This is just a very badly written example, not something that should
      be used in any application.
